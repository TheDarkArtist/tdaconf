### This is supposed be a gloal config files automated copy sciprt for base < my arch-i3 setup>

so idea is to just run the script and do a bunch of mannual labor that i want to avoid doing

It will contain all my configs for arch-i3, which will include every mannual thing that i had to do like alacritty.toml, nvim, tmux, i3, polybar, polkit etc...

I'm going to create a list of all the thing it does contain
