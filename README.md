### This file is supposed be a gloal config file for base < my arch-i3-xfce setup>

It will contain all my configs for arch-i3-xfce, which will include every mannual thing that i had to do like alacritty.toaml, nvim, tmux, i3, polybar, polkit etc...

I'm going to create a list of all the thing it does contain
